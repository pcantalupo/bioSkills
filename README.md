# bioSkills

A collection of skills that guide AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, OpenClaw) through common bioinformatics tasks.

## Project Goal

```bash
./install-openclaw.sh                            # Install all skills globally
./install-openclaw.sh --categories "single-cell,variant-calling"  # Install specific categories

```

All installers support `--categories` for selective installation and `--dry-run` for previewing. Codex and Gemini convert to the Agent Skills standard (`examples/` -> `scripts/`, `usage-guide.md` -> `references/`). OpenClaw keeps the original directory structure and optionally adds dependency metadata with `--tool-type-metadata`.
